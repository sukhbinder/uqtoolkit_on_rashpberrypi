/**
 * \class XMLElement
 *
 * This is the implementation of a node in an XML parse tree.
 * Each node contains the following three containers, any (or all) of which
 * may be empty.
 *
 * attributes (XMLAttributeList):  Contains attributes (key/value pairs).
 * children (Vector<XMLElement>):  Contains children of this node.
 * content (Vector<std::string>):  Contains content (text) data.
 * 
 * The implementation is very limited.  In particular, the following
 * advanced features are missing:
 *
 * encoding:  Support for character types other than char/std::string.
 * comments:  Allowing comment blocks to accompany each element.
 * other xml types (control statements, etc.).
 *
 * This implementation is heavily based on Kevin Long's XMLObject.
