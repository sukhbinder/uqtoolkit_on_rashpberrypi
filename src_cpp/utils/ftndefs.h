 * Names of Fortran routines are often altered by the compiler/loader.  The
 * following macro should be used to call a Fortran routine from C code, i.e.
 *	call sgefa(...)			-- Fortran code
 *	FTN_NAME(sgefa)(...);		-- C code to do the same thing
 * Make sure the fortran names are always lower case in the C code.
 * Specify "wsu" for "with single underscore" if the Fortran compiler appends a single
 * underscore to function names. Use "wdu" for "with double underscore".
