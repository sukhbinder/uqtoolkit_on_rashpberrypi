L-BFGS-B
========
Software for Large-scale Bound-constrained Optimization L-BFGS-B is a limited-memory
quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained optimization, i.e. for problems where the only
constraints are of the form l<= x <= u. The current release is version 3.0. The
distribution file was last changed on 02/08/11.

(If you have an optimization problem with general constraints, try KNITROÂ® )

You are welcome to grab the full Unix distribution, containing source code, Makefiles and User Guide.

L-BFGS-B was upgraded on August 2, 2011 from version Lbfgsb.2.1 to version Lbfgsb.3.0
(see reference 3. below).

Click here to download L-BFGS-B version Lbfgsb.2.1

Click here to download L-BFGS-B version Lbfgsb.3.0

Both versions can be installed using the same commands:

Save the gz file in a fresh subdirectory on your system. To install, first type

    gunzip Lbfgsb.m.n.tar.gz

to produce a file Lbfgsb.m.n.tar.  Then, type

    tar -xvf Lbfgsb.m.n.tar

to create the directory Lbfgsb.m.n containing the source code, Makefiles and User Guide.
