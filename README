See the files LICENSE, COPYING, and COPYING.LESSER for the licensing information

See the pdf file UQTk_manual.pdf for a manual on UQTk. For a brief summary: compilation
instructions are provided below.

Requirements:
* For the C++ libraries: a C++ and Fortran compiler
* For the Matlab codes: Matlab license
* For the examples that use the C++ libraries: Python 2.7, Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib
                                               Expat library for processing xml input files

Compilation instructions for the C++ library:

    1) Define the environment variable UQTK_SRC; for example "setenv UQTK_SRC $HOME/uqtk_dist/working" if
       you are using the csh or tcsh shell
    2) Go to "uqtk_src/working/config" and copy one of "config.*" files to "config.site"
       For example for compiling with gnu compilers, copy "config.gnu" to "config.site"
       For intel compilers on a Mac, take a look at "config.auroch". If compilers are installed similarly
       on your machine then use that config file.
       If not, adjust the path to intel libraries on your machine and rename the config file accordingly
    3) Go to "uqtk_src/working/src_cpp" and type make
